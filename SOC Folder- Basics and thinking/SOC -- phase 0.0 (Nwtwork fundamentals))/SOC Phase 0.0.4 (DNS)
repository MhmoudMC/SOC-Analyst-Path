DNS (Domain Name System) is a naiming service that translates domain names into IP addresses using A (IPv4) and AAAA (IPv6) records, and such ad CNAME, MX, and TX.

A/AAAA; map a domain name to an actual IP address.
CNAME: points one domain name to another domain name (alias).
MX: defines where email messages should be delivered.|
TXT : used for verification, policies, and metadata.


WHY DNS IS IMPORTANT FOR SOC:
Most malicious traffic eventually resolves to A or AAAA records.
Command-and-Control (C2) servers require a real IP address.
Malware may use CNAME records to hide the real destination, but it ultimately resolves to an A/AAAA record.


SOC Note: Malware needs DNS to find its "boss" (C2 server).
