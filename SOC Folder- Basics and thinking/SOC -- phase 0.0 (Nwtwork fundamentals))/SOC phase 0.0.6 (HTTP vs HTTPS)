HTTP vs HTTPS :

1)What is HTTP? Port 80
Http(HyperTxtTransferProtocol) is the "language" used to request and send information on the web.


How it works:
Think of it like sending a postcard.
The Request: You(the client) write a note"plase send me the Home Page" and drop it in the mail.
The Respose: The website(the server) sees your request and sends back a postcard with the website data.

*The Problem*:
Because it's a postcard, anyone who handles it- the mail carrier the sorting facility, or someone looking over you shoulder-can read exactly what's written on it.
*if you type a pssword into an http site, that password is sent in plaintext.
*A hacker sitting on the same WI-FI as you can easily "sniff" the air and see your login details.

2)What is HTTPS? Port 443
Instead of a postcard, think of HTTPS like sending a locked tamper-proof box.
*The Handshake: Before any data is sent, your browser and the server perform a "handshake" to agree on a secret key.
*The Encryption:All data (passwords, credit cards, even pages you visit) is scrambled into gibberish.
*The Certificate: The server shows a :Digital Certificate" (verified by a third party) to prove it is actually the real website and not a fake one set up by a hacker.

*The Benefit:
Eben if a hacker intercepts the "box" while it's traveling, they can't open it. All they see is a mess random characters that look like this:ax%9!zL#2P.

3)Side-by-Side Comparison
Now that you know they work individually, here is how they stack up againest each other 

Feature HTTP HTTPS
Analogy A postcard(open to everyone) A locked safe(private)
Security None. DAta is "plaintext". Higt. Data is "encrypted"
Identity No way to prove the site is real. SSL Certificate proves site identity.
Browser shows "Not Secure" warning. Shows a Padlock icon.
Speed Slightly faster initial connection Slightly slower start, but faster overall today.
SEO No benefit. Google gives a ranking "boost" to HTTPS.

Why HTTPS don't stop the attack, but it make it harder to detect them?
Because the HTTPS is built to "hide" almost everything .
HTTPS only hides the "pipes"(the connections). not the endpoints (person/server).
You can say, if the hacker sends a malware, you won't see it becayse they are encrypted, so the firewall is usless against it in that setuwation.
When the attacker breacks into the computer, he want to sent back alot of informations, if we use http:
A security (SOC) monitor might notice, and asks "why you are sending 5GB of plaintext credit card numbers to randdom IP address?" <-- my thought here, since the soc don't know if the company wants to change the save location for the credit card, he would ask first, if the one who works say "i didn't do it" then isolation the device, imiditially. and escelate it as true positive alert.
But over HTTPS: the monitor just sees "this computer is have a private encrypted conversation." <--- i think there is some sort of system, that inside of the company's deivces, to make SOC sees what happe's.

Blending In: hackers use"command and Control" (C2) servers that communicate over port 443 (the standard) TO a network administrator.


How do experts "detect" attacker then?
*Traffic Analysis:we look at the size and timing of boxes.if computer is sending juge "boxed to a server in suspicious country at 3 AM, that's a redflag
*HTTPS:INspection (SSL decryption):In bif companies, the fire wall actuall "Unwarps" the HTTPS box, chexks the contents for viruses, and then"re-wraps" it before sending it to the user.
*Endpoint Monitoring: Instead of watching the network, they put software on the actual computer (like an Antivirus) to watch the data after it has been decrypted by the browser.<-- I expected that earlier !.

HTTPS protects data confidentiality, but attackers abuse it to hide malicious communication. SOC analysts therefore rely on metadata, traffic patterns, DNS behavior, and endpoint telemetry rather than content inspection alone.
