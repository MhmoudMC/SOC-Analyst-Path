1.The DNS Request (The Phonebook)
Your computer doesn't understand names like "google.com". it only understand IP addresses 
(numbers).
*Action: You browser asks a DNS Server, "What is the IP for this name?".
*SOC Tip: If a user visit a malicious site, you will see the "query" for that site in the DNS logs.

2.The TCP Handshake (The Greeting). Once your computer has the IP address, it needs to start a reliable connection. this is called the "Three-Way Handshake"
*SYN: Your computer sys, "Hello, can we talk?"
*SYN/ACK: The server says, "Hello! Yes, I am ready."
*ACK: You computer sys, "Great, let's start!"

3.The TLS Handshake (The Secret Code).
Because most websites use HTTPS, they need to encrypt the data so hackers cannot read it.
*Action: Your computer and the server agree on a "secret key" to lock the data.
*SOC Tip: Since the data is encrypted, a SOC analyst usually cannot see the content of the traffic, only the destination and the size of the data.

4.The HTTPS Request (The Order)
Now that the connection is safe, you browser sends an HTTP GET request.
*Action: it's like a customer in a restaurant saying, "Please give me the 'index.html' page."


5.The Server Response (The Delivery)
The web server receives the request and send back the files (HTML, images, CSS).
*Action: Your browser takes these files and draws the website on your screen.

#Why this matters for a SOC Analyst:
If you see an alert for a "malware Download," you will look at these steps to find:
*DNS Logs: Did the user look for a known bad website?
*Firewall Logs: Did the connection actually happen (was the handshake successful)
*Web Logs: Exactly what file did the server send to the user?
