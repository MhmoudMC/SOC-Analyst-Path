1.THe Event (The Raw Data). An Event is just a record that something happened. it is natural, not good or bad yet,
*SOC Context: A user logs in, a firewall allows a connection, or a file is saved.

*Volume: Huge. You might see millions of these a day.

2.The Alert (The Warning), An Alert happens when an event (or a group of events) breaks a specific rule or looks suspicious.
*SOC Context: A user fails to log in 10 times in one minute. the system flags this because it crosses a threshold.
*Analogy: the camera system beeps because a student is trying to open a locked door at midnight.
*Volume: Moderate. You might see dozens or hundreds a day.

3.The Incident (The Real Problem). An Incident is an Alert that a human analyst(ME) has investigated and confirmed is a real threat that needs fixing.
*SOC Context: You check the alert and see that after the 10 failed logins, the attacker successfully guessed the password and is now stealing files, this is now an Incident.
*Analogy: The guard checks the camera, sees a thief breaking the lock, and calls the police.
*Volume: Low, These are the critical moments that require immediate action.
