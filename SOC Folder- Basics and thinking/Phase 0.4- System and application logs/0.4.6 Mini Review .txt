Host & Application Logging.
1.The Big Picture *The Why*.;
 *Network logs: are the street cameras, they show connections
 *Host Logs are the inside cameras, they show actions
 *Correlation: is the bridge. You need both to prove if an attack actually worked.



2.Knowledge Check: Log Sources
Log Source         Primary Focus for SOC        Key Example
Windows Security   Logins and Permissions       Failed password attempts (4625)
Windows System     Health of the OS             System shutdown or driver failure.
Linux auth.log     Authentication & Sudo        Brute-force or privilege escalation
Web access         every click or URL request   High volume of 404s *scanning*
Web Error          Glitches and Crashes         500 errors (Potential SQL Injection)

3.SOC Thinking Patterns
*Visibility Gap: if an attacker uses a USB drive, the Network log sees nothing, but the host log sees everything.
*The Pivot: start with a Network alert (Computer A talked to a Malicious IP). then check host logs to see what process made that connection?
*Success vs. Failure: a firewall might show an Allowed connection (Success) But the web error log might show 403 Forbidden (Failure at the app level).

4.Critical Analyst Questions:
*Did it work? Check host log for success codes "200 OK or successful login"
*How did it happen? look for the process (like cmd.exe or powereshell.exe) that started that activity.
Is it a pattern? Don't look at one line; look for high frequency (500 pages accessed in one minute).
