the different between Host and Network Correlation is like, the camera in street which's shows the delivery person, and the camera inside the house, shows someone opening the package.

If i only look at the Network logs, i wouldn't know the package is a malware or a gift, but if i only look at system's log i wouldn't know who sent it.


Where Should I start?
1.The "Did It Work?" Check: Network logs often shout "attack!" like a firewall block or IDS alert, but that doesn't mean the computer was hacked.
if we explore the host logs, it will prove if the attack failed or succeeded
2.The "Who Started It?" Mystery: Someone you see a weird process running on a computer *HOST* like powershell connecting to the internet, we can look at how network logs help you find out where is it connecting and why.



what i understand: the logs complete each other, any traffic happen, should be seeing though the logs,
