#What is Syslog? it's:
*A standard logging system in Linux
*A central way services report events
*Used locally and sent to remote logs servers (SIEM)
Key idea: Programs don't usually write random files.
they send messages -> Syslog -> Syslog writes them to log files.

#Where Syslog Lives (very important)
On most Linux systems: /var/log <-- the is the log directory
Inside it, common syslog-related files:
*syslog
*Auth.log
*kern.log
*daemon.log
today i will focus on : |syslog| and |auth.log|

syslog vs auth.log (The core SOC distinction)
/var/log/syslog
it's like a :
*General system activity*Services starting/stopping*Cron Jobs*Network services*Errors, warning, info*
Example: SSH service restart, Networking interface up/down, A daemon crashing.

/var/log/auth.log
This is security gold ##
contains: *Login attempts (success & failure)*sudo Usage*SSH authentication*user account actions*
Example events: Brute-force attempts, user privilege escalation, Unauthorized access attempts

SOC thinking Check (Important)
Step 9 — Escalation thinking (SOC muscle)

You never escalate on one line alone. You look for patterns.

What an L1 checks next:

Same IP repeated? 

Multiple usernames? 

Time window short? 

Other hosts targeted?
