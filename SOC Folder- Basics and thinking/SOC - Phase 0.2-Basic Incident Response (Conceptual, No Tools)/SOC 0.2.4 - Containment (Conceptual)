Containment = stop the bleeding without killing the patient
It's the phase between detection and eradication?

#.Why Containment != Fixing
| Action               | What it really does             |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Containment          | Freeze the attack in place      |
| Fixing (Eradication) | Remove the attacker and malware |

If you fix before containing, the attacker:
*Notices you
*Escaltes
*Wipes logs
*Spreads to other systems.
Think like hunting an intruder:You lock the building first, then you arrest him.

#what containment actually looks like :
Containment is isoltion, not cleaning. Examples"
Isolate Host: a laptop is infected with malware:
-Remove it from the network
-still powered on
-still logged in
-just cut off from everything else

why?
so the malware: * cant move laterally * cant call home * cant infect servers

#Block IP
A hacker is attacking from 45.83.1.22
-firewall blocks that IP. You didn't "catch" him, You just closed the door

#Disable Account
A compromised admin account is detected
-Disable the account immediatley
You didn't remove the hacker
You just removed his key

#Why over-containment is dangerous?
New analysts panic and do this : "OMG ATTACK!!! shut everything down"
THat causes "
Over-containment                          damage
Kill servers                              business outage
Disable all users                         company stops working
Reboot infected system                    You destroy evidence
Block whole subnets                       legit traffic dies 
Now the CEO is angrier at you than at the hacker.
Containment must be: Targeted, minimal, reversible

$Correct mental model
Containment is like putting a virus in a lab jar:
You don't kill it yet
You don't release it 
You trap it so you can:
Study it, Trace it, Remove it safely later


#Where this fits in soc logic
My flow is: Detect => TrIage => Contain -> Investigate -> Eradicate -> Recover
If you skip contain:
You lose control of the incident
If you over-contain:
You become the incident

#Containment is:

*Control without destruction

|This single concept separates:

*Real SOC analysts

*From people who just click buttons 🚨
