The 5 Phases (High-level)
i already saw names. no we attach meaning:
1.Detect
2.Triage
3.Containment
4.Eradication
5.Recovery
6.Lessons Learned
SOC L1 lives mostly in 1-3. Everything else is escalation territory.

#1, Detect - "Something looks wrong"
*Comes from alert, not certainty
*Tools, users, or other teams raise the signal
*Detection != Incident(Yet)
L1 role:Confirm the signal is real enought to look at.

#2, Traige-"Is this bad, and how bad?"
***This is the most important SOC skill.***
*What is happening?
*Is it noise, suspicious, or confirmed?
*Who/What is impacted?
Time important here.
L1 role:Classify, add context, decide contain or escalate.

#3,Containment-"Stop the bleading'
**Key rule:Containment != fixing**
Examples:
*Block IP
*Disable account
*Isolate host
Risk:Over-containment can break business
L1 role: Only basic, reversible action--- or recommend them.

#4Eradication-"Remove the threat"
*Malware removal
*Closing vulnerabilities
*Reset credentials everywhere
L1 role:Usually no action, Provide evidence & timeline

#5,Recovery-"Back to normal safely"
*Restore systems
*Monitor for re-infection
*Validate business operations
L1 role: Observe & report anomalies

#6,Lessons Learned- "How do we not repeat this?"
*Improve detections
*Fix process gaps
*Update playbooks
L1 role:Feed real observations, not opinions.
