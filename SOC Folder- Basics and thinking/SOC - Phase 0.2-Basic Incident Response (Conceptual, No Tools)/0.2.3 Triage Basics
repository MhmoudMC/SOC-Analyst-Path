Triage is the critical step where an analyst determines if an alert is a true positive, how bad it is, and what needs to happen next.


1.Severity vs. Priority
in a SOC, you have to choose Severity or priority 

Feature      Severity                                         Priority
Definition   The intrinsic technical impact of the event      The operation urgency of the response. 
             "How bad" is the attack itself.                  How quickly must we act?

Focus        Focuses on the Threat.                           focuses on the Business Risk. 

Factor       type of malware, privileges gained(root vs User) Criticality of the asset (CEO's laptop vs
             data sensitivity involved.                       guest WI-FI), time of day, current business operations.

Example      A Ransomware strain is detected                  It is detected on a quarantined test machine with no
             (High Severity)                                  network access (Low Priority).

The triage Metrix: Most SOCs combine these two. A High Severity event on a Critical Asset results in a Critical Priority ticket. A High Serverity event on a Low Value Asset might only result in a Medium Priority ticket.




2.The First Questions (The 5 Ws)
When an alert lands in the queue, a SOC analyst acts like a digital detective. You must answer these question immediately to scope the incident.
*WHAT (The Event):
 *What triggered the alert? (Malware signature, Failed login spike, PowerShell execution).
 *What acts were performed? (Did files change? was data sent out?)

*WHO (The Actor & Target):
 *Source: Who is the attacker? (External IP, Internal User)
 *Destination: Who is the victim?(Username, Hostname, Assset Tag)
*WHERE(The Location):
 *Network:Which segment?(DMZ, Internal HR, Cloud, Guest Network)
 *Physical:Which office? (New York HQ, Remote Worker)
 *Endpoint:Where on the disk?(Temp folder, System32)
*WHEN(The Timeline):
 *When did it start?
 *Is it still happening?
 *What happened immediately before and after (Pre-cursor events).


3.Fast Context Building:speed is accurate triage's best friend. you need to build context fast using these tichniques:
A)Internal Context (Know your Environment)
*Asset Value: Is this a domain Controller (Cown Jewel) or a receptionist's iPad?
*User Role: Is jdow running PowerShell scripts normal? (If jdoe is a developer:Maybe. if jdow is in Accounting: Sus).
*cmdb/inventory:Check configuration management database to see who owns the device

B)External Enrichment (OSINT)
*Reputation Checks:Run the IP or Hash through VirusTotal, Talos, or your Threat Intelligence Platform (TIP).
*Sandbox:If you have a file, detonate it in a sandbox (like Cuckoo or Hybrid Analysis) to see what it does.

C)Volume & Frequency Analysis
*The "First Time" Rule: Has this user ever logged in from north Korea before? if no, context suggests high risk
*Brust Check : Did this alert fire once, or 500 times in 1 minutes?(One failed login is a typo; 500 is a brute force)


Summary Checklist for Triage
1.Vaildate:Is this a false Positive? (Did the admin schedule this patch?)
2.Categorize:Assign Severity and Priority.
3.Scope:Answer the 5Ws
5.Escalate or Close:Pass to Tier 2/Incident Response or close as a false Positive.
