Phase 0.5 Review: Traffic & PCAP Thinking 

#1. The "What" and "Why" of PCAPs
*What is a PCAP?: It is a file containing a direct copy of data packets traveling across a network.
*Packet vs. Session: A Packet is a single piece of data, while a Session is the entire "Conversation" (multiple packets) between two devices.
*When to use it: You use PCAP analysis when logs don't give enough detail. logs tell you that something happened; PCAPs show you exactly how it happen.


#2.Connection Patterns (TCP)
*The Handshake: You must understand the SYN -> SYN-ACK -> ACK flow to know if a connection was successful.
*Failure Patterns: If you see many SYN packets without an ACK, it might indicate a Scanning attempt or a server being down.

#3.Identifying Attack Patterns.
In this phase, we look for "shapes" in the traffic:
*Scanning: One source IP trying to connect to many different ports or many different destination IPs in a short time.

*Beaconing: A compromised computer "Checking in" with a hacker's server at regular intervals (like every 19 seconds).
*Exfiltration: Sending a large amount of data out of the network, which often looks like a log session with a lot of "Upload" traffic.
