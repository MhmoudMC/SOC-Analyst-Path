Security Event Correlation:
it actually just mean:Tuning many boriing logs into one meaningful security alert.

What problem does this slove ?
a single log means almost nothing.
but if you link logs :
Time  Source    Event
10:01  firewall connection from russia
10:01   VPN      login failed
10:02   AD       password reset
10:03   AD       Login success
10:04   EDR      New admin process
Now you see possible account compromise

What should you learn inside this skill?
this skill use 4 layers. we'll use SOC language, not theory.

**Layer 1-Log Types(raw meterial): you have to recognize:
Source                       what it tells you
Windows Event Logs           Logins,users,processes
Firewall                     IPs,ports, countries
VPN                          Who connected
EDR(Defender,CrowStrike)     Malware, processes
Web proxy                    websites
Email logs                   Phising
**if you don't know what log means, you can't correlate it.**

**Layer 2-Normal vs Suspicious: you most know if it was normal or not

**Layer 3-Correlation Rules(the heart)
Example rule:If vpn login and ip country != user's usual country and failed login happened before then alert:possible brute force or account takeover.

Layer 4 attack patterns: learn how attack behave:
*Email delivered -> user cliks --> user login --> new IP logs in ---> mail box rules created. = phishing attack, all steps are in the logs.

What are you should gain from these convorsation?|
thik like a SOC detection engineer.
my understand of this spicific phase is:
You should know from where the logs gits collected, that is a huge boost to see from where, and how and what time the attack from, even small ditals, changes dicisions.
