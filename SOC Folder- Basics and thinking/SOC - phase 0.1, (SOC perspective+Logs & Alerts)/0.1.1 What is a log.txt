What is a Log?
In simple terms, a logs is a digital diary. its a record of everything happens on computer.
a server. or a network device.

*Why do we need logs? 
*Evidence: They tell us exactly what happened in the past.
*Visibility: They show us things we cannot see with our own eyes.
*Troubleshooting: They help us find out why something broke.
*Security: They help us catch "Bad actors" trying to break into the system.

Example of a simple log:
If you log into your computer, the system might create a line like this:
"2026-2-8 10:00:1 | User: Ahmed | Action: Login | Status: Success"
"If it isn't logged, it didn't happen." Without logs, we are "blind" to any attacks.
