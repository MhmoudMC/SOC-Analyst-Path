understanding these fields is like a doctor knowing how to read a heart monitor. These are the "who, what, when, and where" of any cyber attack.

1.Timestamp: what it is ? : the exact data and time the event happened.
*Why it matter ?:You connect the dots, if an alert happen at 10P,M. you look for other logs at that same time to see what else the attacker did.
*Pro Tip:ALway check the Time Zone, if your server in london, and i am in libya times might look different.

2.Source IP/Destination IP:What is it? the digital addresses of the computers talking to each other.
*source IP: Who started the conversation.
*Destination IP:Who are they talking to.
*SOC View:if the source ip is from a country your company doesn't work with, it's a big red flag.

3.Source Port/Destination Port: What is it ? ports are like a doors on a computer.
*Destination Port: tells you the service being used. for example:
 |Port 80/443:Web browsing.| , |Port 22: remote login (SSH) | , |Port 53:DNS(Looking for ip).
*Source Port: usually random high number (Like 49152) chosen by the sender's computer.

4.Protocol: What is it? : The laguage or rules the cumputer are using to speak.
*TCP: COmmon for web and email; it makes sure all data arrives safely.
*UDP;Faster, but doesn't check if data arrived(Used for video calls or DNS)
*ICMP: Used for "Pings" to see if a computer is online.

5.Action : What it is? : What did the security tool(Like firewall) DO with this traffic?.
*ALLOW/PERMIT: The traffic went through
*DENY/BLOCK:The security tool stopped the traffic.
*SOC View:If you see 100 Block actions from one IP in minute, someone is  brute-forcing

6.Device/Log Source:What it is? the witness that saw the event.
*Example: a firewall, an antivirus(EDR). or a windows server
*Why it matter: You need to know who is reporting the news. A firewall tells about network traffic, but an antivirus tells about a file in a laptop,

🔍 Breaking it Down
As a SOC Analyst, your brain should automatically pick out these pieces:

Timestamp            : Jan 25 19:40:12 (This happened today!)

Log Source (Device)  : FW-OFFICE-01 (The firewall in the main office).

Protocol             : TCP

Source IP            : 10.0.0.45 (An internal computer on your network).

Source Port          : 51234 (A random high port).

Destination IP       : 203.0.113.5 (An external IP on the internet).

Destination Port     : 443 (The computer is visiting a website using HTTPS).

Action               : Built (This means the connection was Allowed)
