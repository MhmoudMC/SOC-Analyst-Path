This phase introduces the SOC analyst perspective.
The focus shifts from understanding how networks work to understanding how security teams observe, log, and interpret network behavior.

Key concepts introduced:

*Everything generates logs

*Not every event is an attack

*Context is more important than single events

*SOC analysts look for patterns, not isolated incidents

*Detection is based on abnormal behavior, not assumptions|

Simply, in 0.0.x we learned how the network works, in 0.1.x we learned how SOC see it.
