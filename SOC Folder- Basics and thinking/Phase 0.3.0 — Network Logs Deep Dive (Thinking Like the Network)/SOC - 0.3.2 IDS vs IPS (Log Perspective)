#1.What is  IDS vs IPS (Log Perspective)
SYSTEM          MEANING                          CORE JOB
IDS             Intrusion DETECTION System       Observe & alert (نظام كشف التسلسل)
IPS             Intrusion PREVENTION System      Observe, decide, block (نظام منع التسلسل)
Key mindset shift:
IDS : something suspicious happened.
IPS : something suspicious happened, and i stopped it.

#2.Placement matters (this explains the logs)
*IDS placement 
 *Out-of-hand(Mirror/Span port)
 *Cannot block traffic
 *Sees traffic passively
 |Log consequence: IDS logs show what would have happened|
*IPS placement
 *Inline (traffic passes through it)
 *Can drop / reset / block
 *acts in real time
|Log consequence: IPS logs show what was actively prevented|

#3Log structure--What you actually see in SOC 
Typical IDS log fields:
Timestamp
Source IP
Destination IP
Source Port
Destination Port
Protocol
Signature Name
Severity
Action = ALERT
Typical IPS log fields:
Timestamp
Source IP
Destination IP
Port
Protocol
Signature
Severity
Action = DROP / RESET / BLOCK
**Critical difference:
*IDS --> action: alert
*IPS --> action: drop/reset
This single changes incident priority

#4.Signature vs Anomaly (this causes most false positive)
**Signature-based detection (الكشف القاآم على التوقيع)
*Matches known patterns
*Example:
  *SQL Injection
  *Known exploit payload
*High accuracy, low creativity
|Logs look like: Signature: "ET DQL Injection Attempt"

**Acomaly-based detection (الكشف القاىم على الشذوذ)
*Detects behavior deviations
*Example:
 *Too many requests
 *Weird traffic timing
*More false positives.
|Log look like: Anomaly Score: 92....... Baseline Deviation Detected|
SOC truth:
|Most noise comes from anamaly detection|

#5.SOC Reality: Why IDS is noisy & IPS is dangerous
IDS problems:
**Alert on:
 *Scans 
 *Misconfigured apps
 *Internal tools
**High false positive rate
IPS risks:
**Can block:
 *Legit traffic
 *Business apps
**A bad signature = outage
SOC rule:
|IPS signatures must be stricter than IDS signauters.

#6.Decision logic-how SOC treats them.
SCENSRIO                    SOC REACTION
IDS alert only              Investigate Context
IPS Block triggered         High priority
Repeated IDS alerts         Correlate
IPS blocking internal host  Escalate immediately

##Example *thin like l1*
Log 1 - IDS :
Source: 45.33.10
Dest: WebServer
Signature: Port scan
Action: ALERT
👉 SOC thinking:

Is this external?

Is it repeated?

Correlate with firewall denies

log 2-IPS Event:
Source: 45.33.10.9
Dest: Webserver
Signature:  SQL Injection
Action: DROP

👉 SOC thinking:

Attack confirmed

Was data accessed?

Any app logs match?

Incident candidate ⚠️

#8.Mental Model. IDS = visibility, IPS = control
IDS answers: Did I see something?
IPS answers: DID i stop something?


#9.Common SOC mistakes (avoid these)

❌ Treating IDS alert = incident
❌ Ignoring IPS logs because “it was blocked”
❌ Trusting severity without context
❌ Not correlating with firewall + web logs
