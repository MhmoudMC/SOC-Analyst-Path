What is baseline network behavior?
A baseline is simple a picture of what is normal for my network.
like in my routine, can't woke up at 5 or feels pain while running is abnormal.

1.The Normal schedule (Time)
*Baseline: most employees work from 9A.M. to 5P.M. Network traffic is high during these hours and low at 3A.M.
*Anomaly(The Red Flag): a huge 10GB data transfer starts at 2A.M. from a computer that usually sleeps.

2.The Normal Talkers (users & servers) 
*baseline: your web server usually talks to database server and the internet. it never talks to HR manager's laptop.
*Anomaly: suddenly, the web server is trying to ping every laptop in the office.(Scanning).

3.The Normal Language (Protocols)
*Base line: your network uses a lot of https and DNS
*Anomaly: you see a lot of SSH (Remote control) traffic coming from a country where your company has no employees.

How to Think like a Network Analyst:::;
1.Have I seen this before ? (Frequency).
2.Does this belong here ? (Context).
3.Is the size or timing weird ? (Patterns).
