What is at trust zone ? and how it works : a trust zone is a group of systems that share the same security level. as a soc analyst, you will often these three main zones:
*Untrusted Zone (The Internet): this is the wild outside world. we assume it is full of threats.
*DMZ (Demilitarized Zone): this is a middle ground it holds things like web servers that the public needs to access, but it is still separated from the private network.
*Trusted zone (Internal Network): this is where the company's private data and employees live. we trust this area the most.

Why Directionality matters.
Inbound (Outside-->Inside): traffic coming from internet into your network. we watch this closely t stop hackers from entering.
Outbound(Inside-->Outside): traffic leaving your network. we watch this to make sure a virus isn't "Calling home" or stealing sensitive files (Data Exfiltration).

i think it's only about if that allowed or not, like if someone from Internet trying to connect with trusted zone (employ laptop's or HR device) that is sus, also for the DMZ like, if the employ's laptop tried to connect with web server, it's normal, but if the server is the one who tried to connect, that is straight up redflag
