The Logic of a Firewall. In SOC environment, you often compare data (Like an IP address or a port number) against a rule. to do this, we use Comparison Operators:

*== (Equal to) *!= (Not equal to) *> (Greater than) *< (Less than)

//
port = 443
if port == 443:
    Print("Traffic is encrypted (HTTPS). Allow.")
elif port = 80:
    Print("Traffic is unencrypted (HTTP). Alert!")
else:
    Print("Unknown port. Block by default.")
//

build a program that launch critical alert to the analyst if the threat number was above 80, 
and lunch normal alert if it was between 80 and 50,
and mark the traffic as safe if anything else,

//
ip_address = 192.168.12.12
threat_score = 65
if threat_score>80 :
    Print(f"Alert: That IP {ip_address} is critical, firewall blocked it automatecley")
elif threat_score<50:
    print("traffic isn't suspicious, connection allowed")
else :
    print(f"Alert, that IP {ip_address} is suspicious, the firewall didn't stop the traffic, recommendation: investigate + sandbox")
