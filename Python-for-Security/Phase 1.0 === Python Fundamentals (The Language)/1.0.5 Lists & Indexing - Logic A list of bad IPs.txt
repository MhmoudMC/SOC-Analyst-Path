Think of a List like a notebook where you write down a sequence of items, such as a "Blacklist" of IP addresses.

1.What is a List?, A list is a way to store multiple items in a single variable.
In python, we use square brackets ([]) to create them.

//# A list of bad IP addresses (The "Blacklist")
bad_ips = ["192.168.1.50", "10.0.0.7", "172.16.0.25"]//

2.Indexing: Finding the Position,
Every item in a list has a "seat number" called an Index.
In python, start counting at 0, not 1 (Like java)

*How to use it in code:
//#To get the first IP in your list:
print(bad_ips[0]) #Result: 192.168.1.50

3.Basic List Actions for a SOC Analyst
You often need to change your list as new threats appear.
*Adding an IP: Use ".append()" to add a new threat to the end of your list.
//bad_ips.append("1.1.1.1")//
changing an IP: If you made a mistake at index 1, you can overwrite it.
//bad_ips[1] = "10.0.0.11"//
*Checking Length: Use "len()" To see how many bad IPs you are tracking.
//print(len(bad_ips)) # Tells you the total count//
