we don't just print text, we need to store information like IP addresses, Port numbers, or Threat Levels so we can use them later in our script. we do this using Variables.

A variable is like a labeled box, you put data inside it, and you gave the box a name.

In python, we have different "types" of data:
*String(str): Text, like an IP address "192.168.1.1"
*Integer(int): Whole numbers, like a Port number 443.
*Float: Numbers with decimals, like a "Chaos' level 0.85.

How to create a Variable? You just give it a name, use the = sign, and then give it a value.
*Variable name: ip_address
*Assignment: =
*Value: "192.168.1.1" (Don't forget the quotes for strings!)

to make an string thing like {ip_address = 192.168.0.0} you have to add (") to 192.....
to print different types of values, you have to make it like that :
*{print("Alert: ... " + str(port_number))}. or like that :
*print(f"Alert: Connection on Port {port_number}")
