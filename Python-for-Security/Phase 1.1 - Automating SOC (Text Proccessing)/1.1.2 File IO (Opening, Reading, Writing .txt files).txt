This is a critical skill for a SOC analyst because almost all logs (firewall logs, server logs) are just simple text files

The Concept: The "Book" Analogy. Think of a text file like a physical book, to git info from it, you have to follow three steps in order:
1.Open the book, 2.Read the page (or Write a note in it), 3.Close the book

Step 1: Opening the File, In python, we use the open() function. But we have to tell Python why we are opening it.
Are we just looking, or are we changing things?

We use "modes" for this:
*"r" = Read. You can look, but you can't touch (Safe for evidence).
*"w" = Write. This wipes the file clean and starts fresh. (Dangerous of original logs!)
*"a" = Append. This adds new lines to the end of the file without deleting the old ones.

Step 2: Reading the data. There are three main ways to read the "Books" in python:
1. '.read()': Reads the entire book at once. this is fast but can crash your computer if the log file is huge "Like 10GB"
2. '.readline()': Reads just one line at a time. it's like reading one sentence, then stopping.
3. '.readlines()': Reads the whole file puts every line into a List!.

/, .readlines() is very popular for SOC analysts. It turns a file into a list of "IP addresses" or "Events" that you can loop through/

//# 1. Open the file in Read mode
my_file = open("whitelist.txt", "r")

# 2. Put every line into a List
all_lines = my_file.readlines()

# 3. Print the list to see what we got
print(all_lines)

# 4. Close the file (Important!)
my_file.close()
//


step 2: Writing (The "Report" Phase), sometimes, you find a bad "Bad IP" and you want to save it to a new file called 'alerts.txt'


we use the mode 'a' Append so we don't delete old alerts.
//#Open the file in Append mode
report = open("alerts.txt.", "a")
# Write a message
report.write("Alert: Unauthorized access detected!\n")
# Close it to save changes
report.close()

#The "With" Keyword (The Pro Way)
Professional SOC analyst usually don't use f = open(). they use a block called with. 
the best thing about with is that automatically closes the file for you, even if your code has an error.
//with open("logs.txt", "r") as f: 
      data = f.read()
# No nead for f.close() here!, It closes by itself.

Summary of Models for SOC Work
Mode     Name         What it does to your Evidence
"r"      Read         Safely looks at the logs without changing anything.
"w"      Write        Deletes everything and starts a new file.
"a"      Append       Adds new data to the bottom of the existing file.

#What i Understand:
using models is like clicking the view or delete or admin button, each one of them open the application or the file in different way,
# Part 1: Read the logs
with open("server_logs.txt", "r") as log_file:
    all_logs = log_file.readlines() #this change the file into list.

# Part 2: Filter and Save
# We use "a" to append so we don't delete old alerts.
with open("suspicious_activity.txt", "a") as report:
    for line in all_logs:
        # Check if the word "Failed" is in this specific line
        if "Failed" in line:
            # Write that line into our report file
            report.write(line)
