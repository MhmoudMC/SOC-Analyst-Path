error handling keeping scripts alive, your scripts will encounter unexpected situations:
*Missing log files
*Corrupted data
*Permission errors
*Network timeouts
#Without error handling, your script crashes and stops working:
//#Bad - script crashes if file doesn't exist
file = open.("firewall_log.txt", "r")
logs = file.read() #CRASH if file missing!
//

#With Try/Except, your script handles problems gracefully:
// #GOOD - script keeps running
try:
    file = open("firewall_log.txt", "r")
    logs = file.read()
    print(f"Successfully read {len(logs)} characters")
except FileNotFountError:
    print("Alert: Firewall log file not found. Using default empty log.")
    log = "" # Set default value so script can continue


I will try to make a project with that code.
