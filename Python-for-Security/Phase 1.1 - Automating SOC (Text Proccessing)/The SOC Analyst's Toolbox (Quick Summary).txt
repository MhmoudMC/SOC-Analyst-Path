1. The Basics (The "Language")
*Variables: these are like boxes. each box can hold one type of thing,
*Data Types: 
      1.Strings: are text (like ips)
      2.Integer: are whole numbers (like ports)
*Conditionals: (if/else): this is your Firewall logic. If a threat score is > 80, block it: otherwise let it pass.
*Modulo (%): Used for sampling. IF you have a million logs, you use %100 to look at every 100th line to see a "baseline" of what is normal.

2.Organizing Data (The "Containers")
*Lists: A simple Queue or notebook of items (like a blacklist of IPs) you find things by their position (starting at 0)
*Dictionaries: A database that link two things together (Mapping) for example linking an IP (Key) to it's Login Failure Count (Value). it's much faster for finding specific data than a list.

3.Processing Logs (The "Automation") 
*Loops:
   *for: Use this to scan a specific list (Check these 10 IPs)
   *while: Use this for live monitoring(Keep watching until an intruder appears)
*String Methods:
  *.strip(): Clean messy spaces(whitespace) from logs
  *.split(): Chops a long log line into a list of words so you can grab the IP.
*File I/O:
  *Use //open(file, "r")// to read logs safely.
  *use //with open// because it's the "Pro Way" that closes the file automatically so your scripts doesn't crah.

A Simple Mental Map:
  List = A pile of evidence.
  Dictionary = an organized file cabinet
  Loop = The analyst searching through the pile.
  if/Else = The decision to keep or toss the evidence.
