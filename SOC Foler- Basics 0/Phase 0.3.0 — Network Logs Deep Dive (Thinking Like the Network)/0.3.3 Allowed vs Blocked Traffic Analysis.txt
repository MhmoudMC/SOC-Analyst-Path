Being able to quickly tell the difference between allowed and blocked traffic is one of most important matrix skills. It helps you decide if you should stay calm or start an incident response.

1.The Core Difference: Intent vs Impact
Feature        : Blocked                            : Allowed 
What it means  :   someone tried, but the firewall  :Traffic successfully past 
                   stopped them.                    :Thought the door

Analyst view   :  Represents Intent, it shows what  :Represent Impact. It shows what
                 attacker trying to do              :Actually Happened

Example        : 1,000 hits on different ports      :A "bad" IP connects to your Database
                 from one IP (Scanning)              on Port 3389 (Success)




Reaction       : Observe patterns in the "noise".   :Panic/Act. this is a potential 
                                                     critical incident


2.Analyzing Direction (Inbound vs. Outbound); you most look at the direction of the traffic


Inbound (Internet --> my server or data base)
*Deny is normal: The internet is full of "noise" and bots scanning for open doors. the fire wall is just doing its job
*Allowed is Scary"Unless it going to a public web server, an external IP should not be allowed into your internal network.

Outbound(My server or data base --> Internet)
*Allow is normal: users browsing google or checking email.
*Deny is suspicious: why is a private server trying to talk to a random IP in another country, this could be an infected device trying to call home to a command&control C2 server.


3.The "Bouncer" Analogy. think of the firewall as a bouncer at a club:
*Deny: The bouncer saw a criminal and didn't let him in, safe, but you know a criminal out
*Allow: the bouncer let the criminal into the club, this is a critical incident.


4.IDS vs IPS Perspective: when looking at these logs the action field 
  changed base on the tool;
*IDS(Detection): Always says ALERT> it only watches; it doesn't stop anything.
*IPS(Prevention):Sys DROP or BLOCK. it actively stopped the threat.
 SOC Tip: if you see an IDS ALERT for high-severity attack, you must check the firewall logs immediately to see that traffic was actually allowed or blocked later in the chain.

5. Summary Checklist for Analysis: When you see a log, ask these 4 questions*The 4 Pillars)
*1.Timestamp: did this happen at weird time (Like 3 Am.)?
*2.Source: is this an internal user or a random external Ip?
*3.Destination * Port: are they hitting a sensitive server (Finance) or a common one (WEB)?
*4. Action: was it Allowed (Impact) or Denied (Intent)?
