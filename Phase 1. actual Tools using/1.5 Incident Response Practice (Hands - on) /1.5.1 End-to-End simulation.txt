the Lifecycle of simulation, 
*Detection {Splunk trigger alert}
*Alert {notice notable event}
*Triage {you use initial triage checklist to decide if it is a true positive or not}
*Containment {you follow playbook to stop the attacker}
*Root Cause: {You perform a deep-dive investigation into how attack happened}
*Report {Write a professional incident report documenting every step.


Step 1: Detection & Alerting, you don't just look at logs, THE SIEM (Splunk) uses Logic to find bad things automatically.
*The Trigger: A rule runs in the background. like "If 10 failed logins happened in 1 minute, alert"
*The Notable Event: This is the alert you see on your dashboard.

Step 2: Initial Triage (The "Quick Look"), here, you need to decide if this is a TP or a FP
Using Initial Triage Checklist, you mist check:
1.Who is the use ? 
2.Where is it coming from ? (The Source IP is like 185.220.101.4)
3.Was it successful? You must search for EventCode=4624 or accepted password to see if the attacker actually got in.
