This is one of the most important skills for a SOC analyst. We call it "Pivoting."

the analyst see an alert, he uses it to find the person or the malware.

In a SIEM (like Splunk 0r ELK), we pivot using fields like:
*Source IP (src_ip)
*Username (user)
*Hostname (host)
*Filename (file_name)

1.The "Time-Window" Search, time is my most important anchor.
if an alert start at 10:00:00 AM, searching "All Time" is too noisy, and searching only that exact second might miss the cause, we usually create a "Search Buffer" around the event.
*Look Back: Check 5-10 minutes before the alert to find the "Infection Vector" (Like a web download or an email attachment being opened)
*Look Forward: Check the minutes after the alert to see if the malware started talking to a Command & Control (C2) server or encrypting files.

In splunk or ELK, you can use the time picker or specific syntax (Like earliest=-10m@m latest=+5m@m) To lock your view to this window.

#Important: in cybersecurity, we use a Hash (like SHA-256 or MD5)
*A hash is like a fingerprint or DNA for a file
*If I take a piece of malware and rename it from virus.exe to chrome.exe, the name changes, but the hash stays exactly the same.

If you find a suspicious file, you can take its hash and search for in in SIEM.

Step 2. The "Process Tree" Pivot
Now that we know what the file is (using the hash) and when it arrived (using your time-window method), we need to see who started it.
In windows every program is started by other program (a "Parent")
*Normal: chrome.exe (Parent) -> downloads -> installer.exe (Child)
*Suspicious: outlook exe. (Parent) -> starts -> powershell.exe (Child).

3. The "Lateral Movement" Check
Lateral Movement is when attacker gets inside one computer (Like the HR laptop) and then tries to jump to other computers like server or ceo's laptop to find better data.

To find this in SIEM, you pivot using the Source IP of the infected machine.
*The Logic: if we know 10.0.0.55 (the HR laptop) is infected. we search all network logs when src_ip="10.0.0.55".
*WHat to look for: Is that laptop suddenly trying to connect to a database it never touched before? Is it trying to "Log in" to 50 different computers in 1 minute?

Summary of 1.2.3: The Investigator's Toolkit
By combining these three, you become a high-level SOC analyst:


Time-Window: You find when it happened.


Process Tree: You find how it started (The Parent).


Lateral Movement: You find where the attacker went next.
