Triage is like working in hospital emergency room. you have many patients (Alerts) coming in, and you cannot treat everyone at once. you must quickly decide:
1.Who is dying? (Critical security incidents)
2.Who is just sick? (Minor issues)
3.Who is actually fine? (False positives/glitches)

Your goal in triage is not to fix the problem yet. Your goal is to classify it so you know where to spend your time.

to do this effectively, analysts use a mental "Triage Checklist"

The Initial Check (The "Is it Real?" test), 
*You look a Timestamp, is it high velocity (15 tries in 1 minute) Or 5 in 10 minutes?
*You look for who? did the attacker tried it with multiple account in the company?


The Initial Triage Checklist (1.4.1):

Question                      why it matters

Is the source known?         is this a known company server or
                             a random IP from the internet?

Is the activity successful?  did the attacker actually get in (status=success)
                             or were they blocked?

Is this "Normal" for         Does this person usually log in at 3AM or 
this user ?                  is this new behavior?

Are there other alerts?      Is this the only alert, or are there
                             10 other alerts for this same computer?
