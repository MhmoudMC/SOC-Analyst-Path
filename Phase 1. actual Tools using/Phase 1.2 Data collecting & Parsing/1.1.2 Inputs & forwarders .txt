The Concept: The "Mailman" of the SOC
Imagine you have 1,000 servers. you cannot log into each one every day to cope a text file
*The Universal forwarder (UF): this is a tiny piece of software installed on the "Client"
(the computer generating the logs). it acts like a mailman.
*The Job: it watches a specific file. When a new line is written to that file, the UF immediately grabs it, wraps it up, and sends it to your Splunk Indexer (usually on port 9997)

The UF is very simple. It only cares about two things, which are defined in .conf files:
1, inputs.conf(The "What"): This tells the UF which files to watch.
  *Example: [monitor://c:\FakeLogs\*,txt] - Watch every text file in this folder.

2, outputs.conf(The "Where"): This tells the UF where your Splunk server is.
  *Example: server = 192.169.1.50:9997 - send everything to this IP address.

#Objextive: Draft a valid inputs.conf stanza to monitor the Fake Logs folder.
Reference Material (Syntax):
