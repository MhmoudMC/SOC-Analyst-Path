 Log lifecycle: The Journey of data,
in this lesson, we look at piece of information (Like a login attempt) travels from a computer to your SIEM dashboard.

#The four main stages:
*Ingestion: its's the collection phase, siem pulls raw data from servers, firewalls, or apps,
*Parsing: SIEM reads raw text and breaks it into pieces (User, IP, Time) using patterns like Regex
*Normalization: Making different logs speak the same language. for example changing src and source address both to src_ip.
*Retention: deciding how long to keep the data before it's deleted to save space.


Main understand :
Splunk Search Bar using like a command prompt like:
// index="main" user="guest" | table _time, src_ip, status //
index="main : search inside the main bucket
user="guest" : status of user, if he was an admin or developer or guest
table _time, src_ip, status : i think these are for telling splunk what it should show to me,
