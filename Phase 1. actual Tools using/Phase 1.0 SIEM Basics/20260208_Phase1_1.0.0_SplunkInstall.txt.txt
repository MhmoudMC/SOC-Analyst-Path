#In pytbon, variables store data, in splunk, the Indexer stores data.
*The Indexer: The database where logs are stored.
*The Search Head: The web interface where you write queries.
#Why does this matter? if splunk gets slow, it's usually because the Indexer (My hard drive) is busy. if the website doesn't load, the search Head service is down.
