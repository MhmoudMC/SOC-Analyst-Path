
In the SOC, data comes from many different places. To be a great analyst, you must recognize these formats even when they are "raw" (not parsed yet). Here are the three most common types you will see:


#Syslog (Linux/Network): usually a single line.
It start with timestamp and the hostname, followed by process name:
* Example: Feb 11 10:00:01 my-linux-server sshd[1234]: Failed password for root from 192.168.1.50

#Windows Event Logs (XML): These are very detailed.
windows stores logs in a structured way that includes "Event IDs" (Like 4625 for a failed login).

#JSON (Cloud/Web): These are very easy for SIEMs to read because the use "Key-Value" pairs.
* Example: {"user": "admin", "action": "login", "status": "fail", "src_ip": "10.0.0.5"}
