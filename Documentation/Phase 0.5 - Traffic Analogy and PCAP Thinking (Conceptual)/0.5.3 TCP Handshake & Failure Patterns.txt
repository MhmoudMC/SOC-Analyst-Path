A. The 3-Way Handshake (The "Hello") : Before two computer send data, they need to agree to talk.
*1.SYN (Synchronize): Computer A says, "Hey, i want to talk, here is my starting number"
*2.SYN-ACK z(Synchronize-Acknowledgement): Computer B says "I hear you, I also want to talk Here id my number, and i got yours"
*3.ACK (Acknowledgement):Computer A sys, "Got it, Let's start".


B. Failure Patterns *The Red Flags*: you often look for broken handshake. these tell a story:
*SYN followed by RST (Reset):The destination is there, but the port is closed. It's like knocking on a door and someone shouting "Go away!"
*SYN followed by nothing (Timeout): there might be a firewall dropping the packet, or the computer is offline. it's like knocking on an empty house.
*Many SYNs to many different ports: this is a Port Scan. an attacker is rattling all the doorknobs to see which one is open.

#The Established state: IN soc monitor (SIEM) we look for connection;
*SYN_SENT: The client is waiting.
*ESTABLISHED: The 3-way handshake finished successfully.
*Why it matters: if i see an internal server with 5,000 ESTABLISHED connections to an unknown IP in Russia, that is a huge red flag for data being stolen.

#The FIN Flag (The "Goodbye"), that is the fishing flag:
*FIN: This is the "Graceful" Way to close a connection. Computer A sys, " I'm done," and computer B sys "Okay, me to".

*SOC Tip: Attacker sometimes use RST instead of FIN to close a connection quickly so they don't leave as many traces in certain logs.

#Swquence Number (The Paper Trail):TCP ensures papers are organized from 1 to 100. These are called Sequence;
*How it works: Each packet gets a number. if the soc sees packets arriving out of order or with "jumping" numbers, it could mean someone is trying to hijack (Steal) the session.

Is there a gap?
