Here is the “Screenshot” (Use this exactly)
🔹 Event / Alert / Incident

    Event: any logged action (neutral)

    Alert: event(s) flagged by a rule
  
    Incident: confirmed malicious activity with impact

🔹 When does Alert become Incident?

   Only when at least one exists:

       Confirmed malicious behavior

       Asset / user impact

       Policy violation

       Required response action

   No impact → no incident.

🔹 Escalation Link

   Alert → investigate (L1)

   Incident → escalate based on:

      Impact

      Confidence

     Asset criticality

🔹 Analyst Rule

   If I cannot clearly describe what happened, where, when, and impact,
   it is not an incident yet.

#How to use this

    Keep it one small section

    Do not expand it later

    When confused in future phases → glance → continue

That’s it.
