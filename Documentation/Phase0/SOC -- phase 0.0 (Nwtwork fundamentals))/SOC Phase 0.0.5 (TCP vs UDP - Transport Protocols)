What is the TCP?
The TCP protocol is responsible for organizing the transmission of data over the Internet to ensure that it arrives properly and completely.

its like a someone who make sure taht every paper had come, and it's organaizied from 1 to 100, and if one gun, he ask the server to send it again.
usually used for email, web browsing, file transfers.

How tcp works: the 3-way handshake
before tcp sends any data, it must create an official connection between server and clinet. by these steps:
1.SYN(Synchronize): the client sends a request to the server to start a connection.
2.SYN-ACK(Synchronize-Acknowledge): the server receives the request and sends back a message sying"I'm ready, let's connect".
3.ACK(Acknowledge) the clinent sends a final confirmation back to the server. the connection is now "established".

What is the UDP?
|it kinda doing the same things, but without making sure the files isn't damaged or lost, and it's faster.
usually used in video calls, streeming, 



Feature     : TCP(Transmission Control Protocol)  : UDP(User Datagram Protocol)    .
Reliability : Guaranteed(Retransmits lost data)   : Best effort(No retransmission) .
Order       : Guaranteed                          : Not guaranteed                 .
Speed       : Slower(due to overhead/checks)      : Much faster(minimal overhead)  .
Common Use  : Web browsing, Email, File transfers : Gaming, Streaming, Video calls .

Real-World Applications:
TCP is the foundation for most of the protocols you use daily:
HTTP/HTTPS: for browsing the web.
SMTP: for sending email.
FTP/SFTP:for transferring files.
SSH: for secure remote access to computers.

flag      : the meaning in soc                                                                .
SYN       : trying to start new connection                                                    .
SYN-ACK   : the server accepted and ready                                                     .
ACK       : cenform the connection or receive the data                                        .
RST(Reset): close the connection imeddially, (it may realte to a "firewall declin or hack try).
FIN       : end the connecition normallu                                                      .

what did i understand?
tcp make sure is the files comes without damaged, or lost, and sent a request to the server to resend files that lost or currepted. it's slower, for emails or web or file transfer.
udp is the same, but didn't make sure of that data if currepted or lost, and it usually used for gaming, streaming, video calls.

HOW DID IT APPERS IN SOC MONITORS?
Protocol : what we see in SIEM                : the expect attack possible.
TCP      : alot of SYN without ACK            : SYN FLOOD (DDoS)          .
TCP      : one connetiion with multiple ports : Port Scanning             .
UDP      : unecpect encreas in the Bandwidth  : UDP Flood / DDoS          .
UDP      : huge/Repeted DNS request           : Amplification / Tunneling .

SOC Note: A flood of SYN packs without ACKs = SYN Flood (DDoS).
