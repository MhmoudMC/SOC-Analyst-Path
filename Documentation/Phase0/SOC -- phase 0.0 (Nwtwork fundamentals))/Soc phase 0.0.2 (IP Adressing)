IP Address 
IP is the logical address, used for selecting a device inside of the Network (Source or destination for communications).
IP don't select the path that packages chose, the direction selected by the routers.
data configuration and verifying controlled by higher layer like TCP




IPv4
it's a 32 bit address, that make around 4,3Billion address around the world.
because of the limitation of address, they created IPv6 like a long term solution .

Public vs Private IP
Public IP: an address that visible for the world and use for access it from outside, (usually the external router address).
Private IP: address inside of the router are use within the private network and are not routed directly over the internet (LAN).
Examples (192.168.0.0/16) , (10.0.0.0.0/8).


NAT
NAT (Network Address Translation) lets more than one device to use one Public IP address
The router performs the translation and maintains a session schedule to link incoming packets to the correct internal addresses.

DHCP 
usually the private IP gifted inside of the Network with  DHCP, that serves gift the devises a according to network policies {not random distribution}

Logs 
Logs are records of technical events that typically include:
timestamp, source IP, source port, destination IP, destination port, protocol, .user-agent or username and maybe ,action/status.
the logs used in soc for analysis : from where comes movements, what time?, what type was the request?, is there any abnormal behavior?.
the records may be collected locally or sent to a central solution (Syslog/SIEM) for analysis and retention.
(when logs show Nmap scan or other reconnaissance activity (such as rapid port scanning or repeated requests across multiple ports), this may trigger an alert.)
The analyst must then analyze the alert to determine whether it is a true positive (a real attack or malicious activity) or a false positive (legitimate behavior, such as internal scanning or monitoring).
