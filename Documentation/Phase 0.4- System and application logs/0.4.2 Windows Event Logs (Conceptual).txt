*Network Logs are like CCTV cameras on street. they see someone walking towards your house and knocking on the door.
*Windows Logs are like the security guard inside the house. they know if the person actually had the right key, if they opened the safe, or if they broke a window.


According to My plan, we need to focus on three specific "buckets" of logs:

##Security Log: Records "audit" events. This is your gold mine. It tracks access. (e.g., Logins, failed passwords, file access).

##System Log: Records events from Windows components. This tracks the health/state of the OS. (e.g., The computer shutting down, a driver failing, time changes).

##Application Log: Records events from installed programs. This tracks software. (e.g., Your Antivirus crashing, SQL server errors).                                                      
                                                                                              
*System logs      : would just tell you if the server itself crashed                        .
*Application Logs : would tell you if the HR software had a bug                             .
*Security Logs    : tell you if someone stole the keys                                      .
