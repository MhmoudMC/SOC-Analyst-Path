1. Access Logs. it's like a fastest documenting, every move, every click or url open, is in the log,
*What it tells me? who came to the site, when, and what they did.
*Key parts for a SOC analyst:
 *IP Address: where the visitor is coming from.
 *HTTP status Code: Did the page load ? (200 is ok, 404 is not found)
 *Request Method: are they just looking (GET) or sending data (POST)?
 *User Agent: what browser or tool are they using? (Attacker often use "Scripts" here).
SOC PRO TIP: if you see on IP address trying to access 500 different pages in one minute, it's likely a web scanner or a brute-force attack.

2.Error Logs. It's like they only record something goes wrong,
*What it tells: why the server failed to do something.
*Key parts for SOC Analyst:
 *Critical Errors: If the server crashed.
 *403 Forbidden: someone tried to go somewhere they aren't allowed.
 *500 Internal Server Error: this cloud mean an attacker sent "bad code" that broke the server (Like a SQL Injection).

Why this matters for you:
In a SOC, you will use a tool like Splunk or ELK to search these logs. If you see many 404 errors followed by a 200 OK on a sensitive page (like /admin), you know someone just successfully guessed a hidden URL.
