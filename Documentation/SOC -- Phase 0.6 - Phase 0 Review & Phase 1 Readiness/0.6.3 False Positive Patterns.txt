In simple terms: A false positive is like a smoke alert going off because you are cooking dinner, not because the house is on fire. the "alert" is real, but the "threat" is not.

Common False Positive Patterns:
Example	Why it happens	pattern 
A server suddenly sends 50GB of data to a backup cloud.	Automated scripts or backups look like "suspicious" behavior because they happen at 3:00 AM.	Scheduled Tasks
A new antivirus update starts scanning every file on the disk.	When a company installs a new tool, it might behave in a way that triggers "malware" alerts.	New Software/Updates
An internal IP address tries to "touch" every port on 100 servers.	Your own IT team might be running "Vulnerability Scanners" to find bugs.	Network Scanning
An alert triggers if a user fails a password 3 times (maybe they just forgot it!).	Sometimes the "threshold" is too low.	Aggressive Security Rules

A dev uses a script to automate a boring task, but it looks like a "Living off the Land" attack.	Developer use "weird" commands or tools that look like hacker tools (Like PowerShell or SSH)	Developer Activity    

How to Identify a False Positive,
                    1.Is this normal for this user/machine ?
2.Is this know IT process? (check with the IT team or look at the schedule)
3.Is the "action" successful or blocked? (A blocked "attack" is often a low priority or an FP).
