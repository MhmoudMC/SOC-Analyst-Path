Part 1: Mini Review :This phaes shifts my perspective from how network work to how soc analyst observe them.


1.The foundation: Logs, Events, and Alerts

*Logs: These are append-only, timestamped records of events. they are"historical trail"used to reconstruct what happ.
*event vs alerts:
#Event are factual record("backup completed") that happed frequently. they are for documentation.
#Alerts are signal generated when logic detects potenial risk(20 failed logins) they require analysis and usually imply current problem.
*The Goal:SOC analysts look for patterns and abnormal begavior, not just isolated incidents.

2.The Engine: Correlation
*Deficition: Correlation is turning many boring logs into one meaningful security alert.
*Why it matters: A single logmeans almost nothing on its own.
*The Logic: You must link data points(Firewall connection+VPN failure+AD password reset) to see full story such as account compromise.
*Prerequeisite:If you don't understand what specific log type(like windows Event logs or Firewall logs)tells you, you cannot correlate it.


3.The Analysis: True Positive (TP) vs. False Positive (FP)
*True Positive: the alert triggered, and the mailcious activity is real. action: Escalate/Remediate.
*False Positve: The alert triggered, but the activity is bening or expected. Action: close and tune.
*False Negative: No alert triggered, but malicious activity occurred. This is a critical failure.


Part 2: Practical Notes (Field Guide): use these as checklist when you are lookingat an alert.

**Investigation Checklist(The "Immediate Checks"): when you see a log, check these three connection immediately:
1.Timestamp:Is the event inside a suspicious time windows(3AM) or overlapping with other event?
2.Identity: is the Source/Destination internal or external? Is the IP/Domain reputation known?
3.Behavior: Is the action (Accept/deny) or protocol expected for this device? is there a pattern like scanning?

**Detecting Attacks
#Scanning INdicators:
  1.look for connection spikes (thousands of ports in seconds)
  2.Look for "Door Ratting" logs: thousands of "connection refused" or "access denied" massages from a single IP.

#Brute Force Indicators:
  1.High volume of failed logins.
  2.Account Lockouts: System often lock accounts after 5-10 fails; widespread lockouts indicate a brute force attack.
  3.Threshold: Understand that attacks are often detected by math:Event + Count +T ime = Alert.

**How to Decide: TP or FP?: use the 3-Pillar Framwork to decide:
A)Verification(Did it happen?:Check raw logs to confirm the event exists. if the error code is PASSWORD_EXPIRED, it likly an FP.
B)Contextualization (Is it normal here?):
*Role: HR running PowerShell is suspicious; a developer doint it might be normal.
*Baseline: has this user done this before? First-time behavior after years of silence is a TP indicatior.
C)Correlation (Is there a trail?): A single alert is weak.A kill chain(Login-->Scanning-->Data transfer)is a confirmed TP.


**Handling Sources(Response Guide)|
*Single IP:Easy to spot. Block the IP to stop the attack.
*Multiple IPs(Disributed):Harder to spot. Use rate limiting because you can't block the whole internet.
*Internal IP:Very alarming, it implies an infected machine or milcious insder.$$Isolate the machine$$.


Pro tip:IF you classify something as a False Positive, you job is not finished. You must suggest tuning(whitelisting a specific user or IP) to reduce future noise.
