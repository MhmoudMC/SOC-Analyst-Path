1.Scanning:
A)scanning i a process of sending signal or data packets to system or network to gather info, it's like testing every doo and windows in the nighborhood to see witch ones are unlocked.

B).Why do attackers scan?
to see the way to enter the devices, like a map of :
*to find which computers or devices are actually in the network,
*and to see which port are open so he can prodacut (port 80 for websites or port 22 for remote login),
*and to odentify what software and version ais runing (windows server 2022 for exmple), 
*to automatically check if those services have known security holes that can easily broken into.

C)
Port scaning: testing the 65535 ports to see which ones are open, goal is to find any listening service, it tells the atacker "door 80 is open"
Service/Version Scanning:once they found an open port, the scanner sends a request to that port to see how it responds
., goal is to see the exact software and version number.


D) What Evidence Scanning Leaves:
Scanning is rarely silent. it leaves:
*Connection spike: the scanner connect to thousands port in few seconds, it's unnatural spike in network traffic.
*Incomplete Handshakes:not completing the connection, whichs takes from system's memory.
*"Door Rattling" LOgs:Firewalls and server will log thousands of"connection refused or access denied" from single IP .
*Specific Patterns: scanner often check ports in specific order, sequential or random. and that triggers as "non-human behaviour"

2.Brute Force:
A)what does Brute Force mean: it mean, computer is using raw power to try every possible combination until it succeeds.
B)What is being Brute-Forced? these:
*Passwords/*Usernames(for finding vaalid email address)/*Encryption Keys(To unlock scrambled file without originalkey)
/*Hidden URLs(Trying thousands of folders name, to find pages that aren't linked anywhere).

C)Online vs Offline *Basic Idea*
Feature   Online Brute Force          Offline Brute Force

Locating  The attacker talks direct   the attacker has stolen file and
          to live website or server   cracking it on their own pc
 
Speed     Slow.Limited by internet    superfast.limited to attacker's 
          speed and servers repond    Hardware

Risk      High. the server sees the   Zero. the victim has no idea the
          failed attempts and can     attack is happening because it's
          block the attacker          not on their system

Analogy   Trying to guss PIN at ATM   taking the ATM home and cutting 
                                      it open with saw
D)Why it is Noisy and Detectable
*Volume of Failed Logins
*Nonsensical DAta: attacker often use"Dictionary List" that include weird characters or strings that no human will typ
*The "account Lockout"Trigger:modern systems are st to Lock an account after 5 to 10, when it brute forces, they lock every user out, wichs calls the support
*Resource Drain: a havey brute force can slow down a website, making it feel like "Min-DoS"

3.What is a Threshold?
A)it defines how many times an event happen within specific timeframe before system considers it sus like :
Even: something happen, count: how manytimes, what time: 60 seconds.


B)why it's Exist:it's like a noise reduction, it just to show that activity isn't human, and even worlks with other apps to block IP.
C)The Challenge: False Positives:
If threshold was to low, it trigger even human simple thing like entering password wrong twice activite trigger, whichs FalsePositive .
Term	    Simple Definition
Threshold	The "tipping point" where activity becomes an alert.
Logic	    Event + Count + Time = Alert.
Goal	    To stop chasing normal behavior and start chasing threats.
Tuning     	Adjusting thresholds to reduce False Positives.


4.what"Source" Means in Attacks:
in any attack there are two main sides the sourc(where attack starts) and destination (the target)

the most common way to identify a source  is by it's IP Address


B)Single vs Multiple Sources:
singe source(One to One)
from i spicific device.  in soc: you see single ip generating huge spike in errors.
Multiple Sources: the attack comes from many different devices at the same time. this often called a distributed attack: a hacker controls 10,000 ifected smart fridges and webcams ordering them to ping the website.
C)Why Source Matters for Detection

A Single IP     :Easy to spot. "Why is this one guy failing so much?"	Block the IP. The attack stops immediately.


Multiple IPs	: Harder to spot. Each IP might only fail twice, so it stays under your [Threshold].	Rate Limiting. You can't block the whole internet, so you slow down everyone. 


An Internal IP	: Very Alarming. The attack is coming from inside your office.	Isolate the Machine. A coworker's PC is likely infected or they are a malicious insider.


A Known"Bad" IP : Reputation-based. The IP belongs to a known hacker group or a proxy service.	Pre-emptive Block. Don't even wait for them to fail; block them on sight.

The Source tells you the scale and location of the threat.
